The histogram above illustrates the distribution of purchase amounts from the dataset corresponding to a past campaign where free shipping was offered for purchases with a total amount exceeding 30€. To determine whether purchase_amount is a suitable running variable with a natural cut-off at 30€, we can observe the shape of the distribution.
The histogram shows a noticeable change in frequency around the 30€ mark, suggesting a potential threshold effect. Values to the left of 30€ represent purchases that did not qualify for free shipping, while those to the right indicate purchases that met the criteria for free shipping. This natural separation aligns with the campaign's conditions, making purchase_amount a plausible running variable for assessing the impact of the free shipping offer. In conclusion, based on the visual examination of the histogram, purchase_amount appears to be a promising running variable for studying the impact of the free shipping campaign, with a clear threshold effect at the 30€ mark.
